## What is Autumn?

Autumn is an open-source layer between Stripe and your application that allows you to create any pricing model and embed it with just a few lines of code. Build subscription systems, credit-based models, usage-based billing, and custom enterprise plans without handling webhooks, upgrades, downgrades, or payment failures.

## Why Autumn?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Billing infrastructure gets complex fast" icon="wrench">
    Building billing is more than just payments. You need:
    - Permission management and feature gating
    - Usage metering and limit enforcement
    - Complex state management for upgrades, downgrades, and cancellations
    - Handling race conditions and edge cases
    - Managing failed payments and retry logic
    
    All of this complexity slows down product development and creates maintenance burden.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Billing and app logic should be decoupled" icon="layer-group">
    Growing companies iterate on pricing frequently:
    - Raising prices for new customers
    - Experimenting with credit systems
    - Charging for new features
    - Offering custom enterprise plans
    
    Without proper separation, each change requires database migrations, rebuilding in-app flows, and managing grandfathering logic.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="One API for all pricing models" icon="bolt">
    Instead of custom code for each pricing strategy, Autumn provides a unified interface. Configure your pricing in the dashboard, then use the same three functions regardless of your model:
    - `attach()` - Handle all purchase flows
    - `check()` - Verify feature access
    - `track()` - Record usage events
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Simplify billing with 3 functions

All your billing logic can be implemented through just three functions:

### 1. Attach - Handle all purchase flows

One function call for subscriptions, upgrades, downgrades, and purchases. Autumn returns a Stripe Checkout URL for new customers or handles the change immediately for existing ones.

```tsx
import { useCustomer } from "autumn-js/react";

function UpgradeButton() {
  const { attach } = useCustomer();
  
  return (
    <button
      onClick={async () => {
        await attach({ productId: "pro" });
      }}
    >
      Upgrade to Pro
    </button>
  );
}
```

### 2. Check - Verify feature access

Check whether a customer has access to a product, feature, or has remaining usage before allowing an action.

```ts
import { useCustomer } from "autumn-js/react";

const { check } = useCustomer();

const { data } = await check({ featureId: "ai_tokens" });

if (!data.allowed) {
  alert("AI limit reached");
}
```

### 3. Track - Record usage events

When a customer uses a metered feature, record the usage event. Autumn automatically enforces limits and calculates billing.

```ts
import { useCustomer } from "autumn-js/react";

const { track } = useCustomer();

await track({
  featureId: "ai_tokens",
  value: 1312
});
```
