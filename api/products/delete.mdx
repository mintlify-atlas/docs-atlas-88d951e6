description: 'Remove a product from your catalog'

## Overview

Delete a product from your catalog. You can delete a specific version or all versions of a product. Deleting a product does not affect existing customer subscriptions.

<Warning>
  Deleting a product is permanent and cannot be undone. Customers with active subscriptions to this product will retain access, but new customers cannot attach it.
</Warning>

<Note>
  Consider archiving products instead of deleting them. Archived products remain in your system for historical reference while being hidden from new customers.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X DELETE https://api.useautumn.com/products/pro-plan \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
```

```bash cURL (All Versions)
curl -X DELETE "https://api.useautumn.com/products/pro-plan?all_versions=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
```

```javascript JavaScript SDK
import { Autumn } from '@useautumn/sdk';

const autumn = new Autumn({
  secretKey: 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'
});

// Delete latest version
await autumn.products.delete('pro-plan');

// Delete all versions
await autumn.products.delete('pro-plan', { all_versions: true });
```

```typescript TypeScript SDK
import { Autumn } from '@useautumn/sdk';

const autumn = new Autumn({
  secretKey: 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'
});

// Delete latest version
await autumn.products.delete('pro-plan');

// Delete all versions
await autumn.products.delete('pro-plan', { all_versions: true });
```
</CodeGroup>

## Path Parameters

<ParamField path="product_id" type="string" required>
  The unique identifier of the product to delete.
  
  Example: `pro-plan`, `enterprise-tier`
</ParamField>

## Query Parameters

<ParamField query="all_versions" type="boolean" default={false}>
  If `true`, deletes all versions of the product. If `false`, only deletes the latest version.
  
  <Warning>
    Deleting all versions removes the product completely from your catalog, including all historical data.
  </Warning>
</ParamField>

## Response

<ResponseField name="success" type="boolean">
  Indicates whether the deletion was successful.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="message" type="string">
  A confirmation message describing what was deleted.
  
  Examples:
  - `"Product 'pro-plan' (version 2) deleted successfully"`
  - `"Product 'pro-plan' (all versions) deleted successfully"`
</ResponseField>

## Response Example

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Product 'pro-plan' (version 2) deleted successfully"
}
```

## Use Cases

### Delete a Specific Version

Remove only the latest version while keeping previous versions:

```javascript
await autumn.products.delete('pro-plan');
```

This is useful when:
- You created a version by mistake
- You want to roll back to a previous version
- You're testing new pricing configurations

### Delete All Versions

Completely remove a product from your catalog:

```javascript
await autumn.products.delete('pro-plan', { all_versions: true });
```

Use this when:
- Discontinuing a product line
- Cleaning up test products
- Removing deprecated offerings

### Safe Deletion Pattern

Check for active customers before deleting:

```javascript
// First, check if any customers are on this product
const { list: customers } = await autumn.customers.list();
const activeCustomers = customers.filter(c => 
  c.products?.some(p => p.id === 'pro-plan')
);

if (activeCustomers.length > 0) {
  console.log(`Warning: ${activeCustomers.length} customers are on this product`);
  console.log('Consider archiving instead of deleting');
  
  // Archive the product instead
  await autumn.products.update('pro-plan', { archived: true });
} else {
  // Safe to delete
  await autumn.products.delete('pro-plan', { all_versions: true });
}
```

### Batch Delete Test Products

Remove multiple test products:

```javascript
const { list: products } = await autumn.products.list();

// Find test products (assuming they have a naming convention)
const testProducts = products.filter(p => 
  p.id.startsWith('test-') || 
  p.name.includes('Test')
);

// Delete each test product
for (const product of testProducts) {
  try {
    await autumn.products.delete(product.id, { all_versions: true });
    console.log(`Deleted test product: ${product.name}`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Failed to delete ${product.name}:`, error);
  }
}
```

### Migration: Delete After Replacing

Replace an old product with a new one:

```javascript
// Create the new product
const newProduct = await autumn.products.create({
  id: 'pro-plan-v2',
  name: 'Pro Plan (New)',
  items: [
    { price: 39, interval: 'month' }
  ]
});

// Migrate existing customers
const { list: customers } = await autumn.customers.list();
const oldPlanCustomers = customers.filter(c =>
  c.products?.some(p => p.id === 'pro-plan')
);

for (const customer of oldPlanCustomers) {
  await autumn.migrate({
    customer_id: customer.id,
    from_product_id: 'pro-plan',
    to_product_id: 'pro-plan-v2'
  });
}

// After successful migration, archive the old product
await autumn.products.update('pro-plan', { archived: true });

// Or delete it completely
// await autumn.products.delete('pro-plan', { all_versions: true });
```

## Best Practices

### Archive Instead of Delete

In most cases, archiving is preferable to deletion:

```javascript
// Archive a product (recommended)
await autumn.products.update('pro-plan', { archived: true });

// Benefits:
// - Keeps historical data
// - Allows reporting and analytics
// - Maintains customer subscription history
// - Can be unarchived if needed
```

### Version Management

Delete specific versions strategically:

```javascript
// Keep production versions, delete test versions
const { list: products } = await autumn.products.list();
const proProduct = products.filter(p => p.id === 'pro-plan');

// If there are multiple versions, delete the latest if it's a test
if (proProduct.length > 1) {
  const latestVersion = Math.max(...proProduct.map(p => p.version));
  console.log(`Deleting version ${latestVersion}, keeping older versions`);
  await autumn.products.delete('pro-plan'); // Deletes only latest
}
```

### Backup Before Deletion

Export product configuration before deleting:

```javascript
// Get the product data
const product = await autumn.products.get('pro-plan');

// Save to a file or database for backup
const backup = JSON.stringify(product, null, 2);
await fs.writeFile(`backup-${product.id}-${Date.now()}.json`, backup);

// Now safe to delete
await autumn.products.delete('pro-plan', { all_versions: true });
```

## Error Handling

Handle common deletion errors:

```javascript
try {
  await autumn.products.delete('pro-plan');
} catch (error) {
  if (error.code === 'not_found') {
    console.log('Product not found or already deleted');
  } else if (error.code === 'forbidden') {
    console.log('You do not have permission to delete this product');
  } else if (error.code === 'has_active_customers') {
    console.log('Cannot delete: product has active customers');
    console.log('Consider archiving instead');
  } else {
    console.error('Unexpected error:', error);
  }
}
```

## Impact on Existing Customers

When you delete a product:

- **Active subscriptions continue**: Customers keep their current access
- **Billing continues**: Existing subscriptions are still billed
- **Features remain active**: Customers retain all product features
- **No new attachments**: New customers cannot subscribe to the deleted product
- **Historical data preserved**: Past transactions and usage remain in records

If you need to remove a product from existing customers, you must:

1. Cancel their subscriptions first using the [Cancel](/api/cancel) endpoint
2. Then delete the product

```javascript
// Cancel all subscriptions to a product first
const { list: customers } = await autumn.customers.list();

for (const customer of customers) {
  const hasProduct = customer.products?.some(p => p.id === 'pro-plan');
  
  if (hasProduct) {
    await autumn.cancel({
      customer_id: customer.id,
      product_id: 'pro-plan'
    });
  }
}

// Now safe to delete the product
await autumn.products.delete('pro-plan', { all_versions: true });
```
