# Delete Feature

Permanently delete a feature from your Autumn account. This action cannot be undone.

<Warning>
**Destructive Action:** Deleting a feature will:
- Remove the feature from all plans that include it
- Stop all usage tracking for this feature
- Delete all historical usage data (depending on configuration)
- Break any integrations that reference this feature ID

Consider archiving the feature instead by updating it with `archived: true`.
</Warning>

## Endpoint

```
DELETE /features/{feature_id}
```

## Path Parameters

<ParamField path="feature_id" type="string" required>
  The unique identifier of the feature to delete.
  
  **Example:** `api_calls`, `team_seats`, `storage_gb`
</ParamField>

## Response

Returns a success message if the feature was deleted.

<ResponseField name="success" type="boolean">
  Whether the deletion was successful.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="message" type="string">
  Confirmation message.
  
  **Example:** `Feature api_calls has been deleted`
</ResponseField>

## Examples

### Delete a Feature

**Request:**
```bash
curl -X DELETE "https://api.autumn.sh/features/old_feature" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Feature old_feature has been deleted"
}
```

## Safety Checks

Before deleting a feature, check if it's in use:

```typescript
// Get feature deletion info
const deletionInfo = await fetch(
  'https://api.autumn.sh/features/api_calls/deletion_info',
  {
    headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' }
  }
).then(r => r.json());

if (deletionInfo.plans_affected > 0) {
  console.warn(`This feature is used in ${deletionInfo.plans_affected} plans`);
  console.warn('Affected plans:', deletionInfo.plans);
  
  // Ask for confirmation before proceeding
  const confirmed = await confirmDeletion();
  
  if (confirmed) {
    await autumn.features.delete('api_calls');
  }
} else {
  // Safe to delete
  await autumn.features.delete('api_calls');
}
```

## Use Cases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Remove Unused Features">
    Clean up features that are no longer needed:
    
    ```typescript
    const { list: features } = await autumn.features.list();
    
    // Find features not in any plan
    const unusedFeatures = await Promise.all(
      features.map(async (feature) => {
        const info = await autumn.features.getDeletionInfo(feature.id);
        return info.plans_affected === 0 ? feature.id : null;
      })
    );
    
    // Delete unused features
    for (const featureId of unusedFeatures.filter(Boolean)) {
      console.log(`Deleting unused feature: ${featureId}`);
      await autumn.features.delete(featureId);
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Migrate to New Feature">
    Replace an old feature with a new one:
    
    ```typescript
    // 1. Create new feature
    await autumn.features.create({
      id: 'api_calls_v2',
      name: 'API Calls (New)',
      type: 'single_use',
      consumable: true,
      event_names: ['api.v2.request'],
      display: {
        singular: 'API call',
        plural: 'API calls'
      }
    });
    
    // 2. Update all plans to use new feature
    await updatePlansToNewFeature('api_calls', 'api_calls_v2');
    
    // 3. Delete old feature
    await autumn.features.delete('api_calls');
    
    console.log('Migration complete!');
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Clean Up Test Features">
    Remove features created during development:
    
    ```typescript
    const { list: features } = await autumn.features.list();
    
    // Find test features
    const testFeatures = features.filter(f => 
      f.id.startsWith('test_') || f.name.includes('[TEST]')
    );
    
    // Delete them
    for (const feature of testFeatures) {
      console.log(`Deleting test feature: ${feature.id}`);
      await autumn.features.delete(feature.id);
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Bulk Delete by Type">
    Remove all features of a specific type:
    
    ```typescript
    const { list: features } = await autumn.features.list();
    
    // Find all boolean features
    const booleanFeatures = features.filter(f => f.type === 'boolean');
    
    console.log(`Found ${booleanFeatures.length} boolean features`);
    
    // Confirm before deletion
    const confirmed = await confirm(
      `Delete ${booleanFeatures.length} boolean features?`
    );
    
    if (confirmed) {
      for (const feature of booleanFeatures) {
        await autumn.features.delete(feature.id);
      }
      console.log('All boolean features deleted');
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Alternative: Archive Instead of Delete

In most cases, archiving is safer than deleting:

```typescript
// Instead of deleting
await autumn.features.delete('old_feature');

// Consider archiving
await autumn.features.update('old_feature', {
  archived: true
});
```

**Benefits of archiving:**
- Reversible (just set `archived: false`)
- Preserves historical data
- Doesn't break existing plans
- Hidden from UI but still functional

**When to delete:**
- Feature was created by mistake
- Feature contains sensitive/incorrect data
- Feature ID is needed for a new feature
- Cleaning up test/development features

## Error Handling

### Feature Not Found

```json
{
  "message": "Feature with id api_calls not found",
  "code": "feature_not_found"
}
```

### Feature In Use

Some implementations may prevent deletion of features in active plans:

```json
{
  "message": "Cannot delete feature that is in use by active plans",
  "code": "feature_in_use",
  "plans_affected": 3,
  "plans": ["pro-plan", "enterprise-plan", "trial-plan"]
}
```

## Response Codes

- `200` - Feature deleted successfully
- `401` - Unauthorized (invalid API key)
- `404` - Feature not found
- `409` - Feature cannot be deleted (in use by active plans)

## Important Notes

<Warning>
**Before Deleting a Feature:**

1. ✅ Check if it's used in any plans (use deletion_info endpoint)
2. ✅ Export usage data if needed for records
3. ✅ Update any hardcoded feature IDs in your code
4. ✅ Consider archiving instead of deleting
5. ✅ Test in development environment first
</Warning>

<Tip>
**Best Practices:**

- Use descriptive feature IDs to avoid conflicts
- Archive deprecated features instead of deleting
- Implement soft deletes in your application logic
- Keep a backup of feature configurations
- Document why features were deleted
</Tip>

## Deletion Workflow

Recommended workflow for safely deleting a feature:

```typescript
// Step 1: Get deletion info
const info = await autumn.features.getDeletionInfo('api_calls');

console.log(`Plans affected: ${info.plans_affected}`);
console.log(`Customers affected: ${info.customers_affected}`);

// Step 2: Notify affected customers (if any)
if (info.customers_affected > 0) {
  await notifyCustomers(info.affected_customers, {
    message: 'Feature api_calls will be removed',
    migration: 'Please upgrade to api_calls_v2'
  });
}

// Step 3: Update plans to remove feature
for (const planId of info.plans) {
  await autumn.plans.update(planId, {
    // Remove the feature or replace with alternative
  });
}

// Step 4: Wait for grace period (optional)
await sleep(7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000); // 7 days

// Step 5: Delete the feature
await autumn.features.delete('api_calls');

console.log('Feature deleted successfully');
```
