Permanently delete a customer from your Autumn account. This action removes the customer and all their associated data including subscriptions, invoices, and usage history.

<Warning>
  **This action is irreversible.** Once a customer is deleted, all their data is permanently removed and cannot be recovered. Consider canceling subscriptions or archiving customer data before deletion.
</Warning>

## Path Parameters

<ParamField path="customer_id" type="string" required>
  The unique identifier of the customer to delete.
  
  ```
  "customer_12345"
  ```
</ParamField>

## What Gets Deleted

When you delete a customer, the following data is permanently removed:

- Customer profile (name, email, metadata)
- All active subscriptions
- All scheduled subscriptions
- Usage history and balances
- Invoice records
- Payment method associations
- Trial usage history
- Referral data
- Custom metadata

<Info>
  **Stripe Integration**: Deleting a customer in Autumn does not automatically delete the corresponding customer in Stripe. You must manually delete the Stripe customer if needed.

## Examples

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X DELETE https://api.useautumn.com/v1/customers/customer_12345 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```javascript JavaScript SDK
import { Autumn } from '@autumn.ai/sdk';

const autumn = new Autumn({ apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY' });

try {
  await autumn.customers.delete('customer_12345');
  console.log('Customer deleted successfully');
} catch (error) {
  if (error.code === 'not_found') {
    console.log('Customer does not exist');
  } else {
    console.error('Error deleting customer:', error);
  }
}
```

```typescript TypeScript SDK
import { Autumn } from '@autumn.ai/sdk';

const autumn = new Autumn({ apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY' });

const deleteCustomer = async (customerId: string): Promise<boolean> => {
  try {
    await autumn.customers.delete(customerId);
    return true;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Failed to delete customer ${customerId}:`, error);
    return false;
  }
};

const success = await deleteCustomer('customer_12345');
if (success) {
  console.log('Customer deleted');
}
```

```python Python SDK
from autumn import Autumn
from autumn.exceptions import NotFoundError

autumn = Autumn(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

try:
    autumn.customers.delete("customer_12345")
    print("Customer deleted successfully")
except NotFoundError:
    print("Customer does not exist")
except Exception as error:
    print(f"Error deleting customer: {error}")
```
</CodeGroup>

## Best Practices

### 1. Cancel subscriptions first
Before deleting a customer, cancel their active subscriptions to ensure proper cleanup:

```javascript
// Cancel all subscriptions first
const customer = await autumn.customers.get('customer_12345');

for (const subscription of customer.subscriptions) {
  await autumn.subscriptions.cancel(subscription.id);
}

// Then delete the customer
await autumn.customers.delete('customer_12345');
```

### 2. Archive important data
Export critical customer data before deletion:

```javascript
// Fetch full customer details with all related data
const customerData = await autumn.customers.get('customer_12345', {
  expand: ['invoices', 'subscriptions', 'entities']
});

// Archive to your database or storage
await archiveCustomerData(customerData);

// Then proceed with deletion
await autumn.customers.delete('customer_12345');
```

### 3. Verify customer identity
Confirm the customer ID before deletion:

```javascript
const confirmDelete = async (customerId: string, expectedEmail: string) => {
  const customer = await autumn.customers.get(customerId);
  
  if (customer.email !== expectedEmail) {
    throw new Error('Customer email does not match. Deletion aborted.');
  }
  
  await autumn.customers.delete(customerId);
};

await confirmDelete('customer_12345', 'john@example.com');
```

### 4. Handle Stripe cleanup
If using Stripe integration, delete the Stripe customer separately:

```javascript
import Stripe from 'stripe';

const stripe = new Stripe('sk_test_...');

// Get customer's Stripe ID
const customer = await autumn.customers.get('customer_12345');

// Delete from Autumn
await autumn.customers.delete('customer_12345');

// Delete from Stripe if exists
if (customer.stripe_id) {
  await stripe.customers.del(customer.stripe_id);
}
```

## Common Use Cases

### GDPR/Privacy Compliance
Delete customer data upon request:

```javascript
const handleDataDeletionRequest = async (customerId: string) => {
  // 1. Export data for compliance records
  const customerData = await autumn.customers.get(customerId, {
    expand: ['invoices', 'subscriptions']
  });
  await exportForCompliance(customerData);
  
  // 2. Cancel active subscriptions
  for (const sub of customerData.subscriptions) {
    await autumn.subscriptions.cancel(sub.id);
  }
  
  // 3. Delete from Autumn
  await autumn.customers.delete(customerId);
  
  // 4. Delete from Stripe
  if (customerData.stripe_id) {
    await stripe.customers.del(customerData.stripe_id);
  }
  
  console.log(`All data for customer ${customerId} has been deleted`);
};
```

### Cleanup test customers
Bulk delete test/development customers:

```javascript
const cleanupTestCustomers = async () => {
  const { list } = await autumn.customers.list({ limit: 100 });
  
  const testCustomers = list.filter(c => 
    c.env === 'development' || c.email?.includes('+test@')
  );
  
  for (const customer of testCustomers) {
    await autumn.customers.delete(customer.id);
    console.log(`Deleted test customer: ${customer.id}`);
  }
  
  console.log(`Cleaned up ${testCustomers.length} test customers`);
};
```

### Delete inactive customers
Remove customers with no recent activity:

```javascript
const deleteInactiveCustomers = async (daysInactive: number) => {
  const cutoffDate = Date.now() - (daysInactive * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
  const { list } = await autumn.customers.list({ limit: 100 });
  
  const inactiveCustomers = list.filter(customer => {
    const hasNoSubscriptions = customer.subscriptions.length === 0;
    const isOld = customer.created_at * 1000 < cutoffDate;
    return hasNoSubscriptions && isOld;
  });
  
  for (const customer of inactiveCustomers) {
    await autumn.customers.delete(customer.id);
    console.log(`Deleted inactive customer: ${customer.id}`);
  }
};

await deleteInactiveCustomers(365); // Delete customers inactive for 1 year
```

## Important Notes

<Warning>
  **No undo**: Customer deletion is permanent and cannot be reversed. Ensure you have backups of any critical data before deletion.
</Warning>

<Info>
  **Subscription cleanup**: All active and scheduled subscriptions are automatically canceled and removed when a customer is deleted.
</Info>

<Tip>
  **Soft delete alternative**: If you need to preserve data for compliance or historical purposes, consider marking customers as inactive in your metadata instead of deleting them:
  
  ```javascript
  await autumn.customers.update('customer_12345', {
    metadata: {
      ...existingMetadata,
      deleted_at: new Date().toISOString(),
      status: 'deleted'
    }
  });
  ```
